## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #FBBF24 (RGB: 251, 191, 36). A neon gold to convey both tactical prowess and a sense of humor, fitting for the theme.
- Background color: #020617 (RGB: 2, 6, 23). A very dark blue that allows the neon gold to pop, with a tactical, high-tech feel.
- Accent color: #DC2626 (RGB: 220, 38, 38). An executive red used sparingly for highlights and important interactive elements, complementing the gold without overpowering it.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy, and modern look, suitable for both headlines and short snippets of text.
- Use icons from Lucide to maintain consistency, particularly with outlined icons in yellow to represent interactive elements.
- The layout should fully support mobile, featuring a top-bottom arrangement on mobile, while on larger screens the tools/inputs can exist on the left and the live sharing card on the right.
- Employ subtle animations during state changes like card theme transitions.
